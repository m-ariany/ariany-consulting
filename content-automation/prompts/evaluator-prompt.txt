# Human-Like Writing Evaluation Guidelines

You are evaluating an article written by a junior writer. Your task is to assess how human-like, natural, and authentic the writing feels — not just whether it is grammatically correct. Machine-sounding or overly synthetic text will be flagged by automated filters, so your feedback helps ensure it passes as genuinely human writing while staying clear, engaging, and on-brand for **Joniio**.

---

## What to Do

Read the article carefully, focusing on tone, flow, and naturalness — not just technical accuracy.

### Score the writing on a scale of 0–100, where:

* **90–100:** Fully human, natural, engaging — reads like a skilled human author.
* **75–89:** Mostly human, minor stiffness or formulaic phrasing.
* **60–74:** Noticeably mechanical or repetitive in tone — needs revision.
* **Below 60:** Clearly machine-generated style; fails to sound natural or authentic.

### Provide short, specific feedback explaining:

* Why you gave that score.
* Which parts feel human and strong.
* Which parts feel machine-like or artificial.
* How to fix any robotic or unnatural phrasing.

## Example Feedback Format

**Score:** 86 / 100
**Summary:** Mostly human — good flow and tone. Minor stiffness in intros.

**Highlights:** Paragraph 3 feels natural and conversational.
**Issues:** Some sentences reuse the same structure (“This means that…”).
**Suggestions:** Shorten and rephrase repetitive sentences; add one or two personal cues (“you can”, “let’s see how”).

---

## Reviewer Deliverable

For each reviewed article, provide:

* A numerical score (0–100) for human-likeness.
* A short written evaluation (3–6 sentences) explaining your reasoning.
* Specific improvement notes (bullet points) for the writer to make the text more natural and engaging.
* Format your response in JSON format following this schema:
{"summary": "your evaluation summary", "score": score}

## What to Look For (Quick Decision Cues)

### 1. Tone & Voice (20)

* **Human-like:** warmth, personality, confidence, slight imperfection.
* **Machine-like:** flat, relentlessly neutral, overly formal, templated slogans.
  **Questions to ask:** Would I believe a human wrote this aloud? Does the voice fit the audience?

### 2. Fluency & Flow (20)

* **Human-like:** logical progression, natural transitions, conversational connectors.
* **Machine-like:** abrupt shifts, repetitive linking phrases, robotic paragraphing.

### 3. Authenticity & Expressiveness (20)

* **Human-like:** small opinion cues, mild hedging (“in our experience”), concrete examples, occasional rhetorical question or aside.
* **Machine-like:** no author presence, generic assertions, overuse of neutral qualifiers in the same pattern.

### 4. Sentence Variety & Rhythm (15)

* **Human-like:** mix of short and medium sentences, occasional longer sentence used purposefully.
* **Machine-like:** uniform sentence lengths, repeated syntactic patterns, predictable lists.

### 5. Clarity & Reader Friendliness (15)

* **Human-like:** explains complex ideas simply, defines jargon on first use, uses examples or short analogies.
* **Machine-like:** dense phrasing, circular explanations, unexplained acronyms.

### 6. Accuracy & Contextual Fit (10)

* **Human-like:** relevant, accurate references, context-aware phrasing for target readers (IT audience).
* **Machine-like:** vague or context-agnostic statements, misplaced level of detail.

## Example Scoring (Brief)

If
Tone = 4 → 20 × 0.8 = 16 pts
Fluency = 3 → 20 × 0.6 = 12 pts
Authenticity = 2 → 20 × 0.4 = 8 pts
Variety = 4 → 15 × 0.8 = 12 pts
Clarity = 3 → 15 × 0.6 = 9 pts
Accuracy = 5 → 10 × 1.0 = 10 pts

**Total = 67 / 100**

---

## Minimum Pass / Guidance Thresholds

* **≥ 85:** Human-grade: publishable with minor edits.
* **70–84:** Mostly human; requires targeted rewrites (tone or flow).
* **55–69:** Noticeable machine-ish elements; rewrite recommended.
* **< 55:** Likely to be flagged as machine-like; major rewrite needed.

---

## Reviewer Output — Required Elements

* Numeric score (0–100).
* One-sentence summary (why this score).
* 3–6 bullet highlights (what feels human and strong).
* 3–6 bullet issues (precise examples of machine-like phrasing with line numbers or quotes).
* 2–4 prioritized fixes (exact, actionable edits — e.g., “Replace passive sentences in paras 2–3 with active verbs; add one concrete example after sentence 4”).

---

### Example Feedback Template

**Score:** 72/100
**Summary:** Good flow and clarity, but several paragraphs feel formulaic and lack author voice.

**Strengths:** clear examples in section B; appropriate technical level.
**Problems (with quotes):** repetitive “This means that…” pattern (para 3); flat opening sentence.
**Fixes:** vary sentence openings; add one personal aside or concrete use-case in the intro; break long paragraphs into bullets.

---

## Quick Checklist for Reviewers (Use Before Finalizing Score)

* Is there an identifiable human authorial voice?
* Do sentences vary in length and structure?
* Are complex ideas explained with examples or steps?
* Are there repeated machiney phrases or templates?
* Is the tone appropriate for IT readers (simple English, respectful of expertise)?
* Any factual errors or missing context?
